## Premature abstraction [sr-only]
<PrematureAbstraction />

### Management and naming hell

However, it involved writing a substantial amount of code in card.css, and it required making numerous decisions along the way:

- What do we call this card?
- `.card` has this class name been used?
- Is there a convention being used that arrives at the name `.card-text`? Has it been accepted by everyone?
- Do other cards use the same style? Is code-sharing working for `.card`?
- If we need to make small adjustments to this card, would we need to create another name?
- The styling of this card might not be reusable.
- What do we call the card on the homepage? How about on other pages?
- Do we adjust `.card` itself for those cards mentioned previously?
- There are other elements that look like `.card`, but they aren't cards!
- `.card` may need to be extended; its style is used in many places.
- Switching back and forth between HTML and CSS
- Is this following best practices?
- ...

The aforementioned challenges were solely focused on styling one card; now, envisage the entire application's styling undergoing the same arduous process...

Traditional approaches often result in imprecise code due to uncertainties and incomplete information.

"You must have a complete design system and pixel-level design guidelines to suitably abstract styles."

### Runaway maintainability

Wait, what would the rest of the team go through when maintaining this code?

- Where is the CSS file for this card?
- Is there another CSS file with rules that affect this card?
- Are there media queries or selectors for this card that I don't know about?
- How does the computed styles of this card look? Do I need to use `!important`?
- If I modify this `.card`, would the modifications leak？
- This card needs to be extended. It looks like we need to create another class name.
- We don't need this card anymore. It should have been removed, so why is it still here?
- Whoever named this card did a poor job...
- ...

The complexities and unpredictability arising from CSS priorities/specificity can make the process even more convoluted. As the project expands, it can quickly become unmanageable, severely impacting productivity.

In contrast, Master CSS offers a "flat" approach to applying styles on elements, avoiding entanglement in complex CSS. This enables team members to onboard more efficiently and reduces the learning curve.

### Syntax-first strategy
It seems that Master CSS is against the traditional abstract coding style?

No, we advocate a mixed development strategy - **syntax first, semantic second**.

Syntax first:
- Styles with no reuse potential.
- Highly specific styles, such as hero landing, home page.
- There is no precise design specification.

Semantic secondary:
- Highly reusable styles like buttons, controls.
- Styles that need to be visually consistent, such as primary color, secondary color.
- Has a standard design system.

Design token is a core methodology for practicing design systems, so appropriately abstracting styles and markup can help you create visually consistent user interfaces more effectively, and Master CSS [configuration](/docs/configuration) is born for this.

Assuming the card can be reused, you can abstract it using [classes](/docs/classes) with a concise syntax:
```js name=master.css.js
export default {
    classes: {
        card: {
            '': 'flex translateY(-5):hover ~transform|.2s overflow:hidden bg:white r:10',
            image: 'object:cover w:140 aspect:16/9',
            content: 'p:25',
            title: 'font:semibold text:18',
            text: 'text:14 lines:2'
        }
    }
}
```
Then, use the abstract class as before:
```html name=card.html
<div class="card">
    <img class="card-image" … />
    <div class="card-content">
        <div class="card-title">Mountain</div>
        <div class="card-text">A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Smart rule sorting
How is CSS rule order and priority handled?

"Center-align the homepage headline when the viewport width `>=1280px`, and align right when `>=1024px`."

(x) Incorrect responsive media rules.
```css
@media (min-width:1280px) {
    h1 {
        text-align: center;
    }
}

@media (min-width:1024px) {
    h1 {
        text-align: right;
    }
}
```
Since the order in which CSS rules are placed affects priority, when the screen width is `>=1024px` or `>=1280px`, `css @media (min-width:1024px) {}` will be applied, but `css @media (min-width:1280px) {}` will never be applied.

You always keep your mind alert to prevent making mistakes, as the more similar rules you have, the harder it becomes to debug.

(o) Let Master CSS handle the prioritization automatically for you.
```html
<h1 class="**text:right@md** **text:center@lg**">
```
No matter how you write the Master CSS syntax, the correct CSS rules will be generated:
```css
@media (min-width:1024px) {
    .text\:right\@md {
        text-align: right
    }
}

@media (min-width:1280px) {
    .text\:center\@lg {
        text-align: center
    }
}
```
Not only that, but we also align rules with your expectations when using selectors like `:disabled`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:where()`, and breakpoints such as `@lg`, `@sm&<lg`, etc. As a result, you would rarely, if ever, need to use `!important`.

### Unit-sensed conversions
In web development, UI design is typically measured using pixels (px). However, to ensure a browser-friendly website, you must convert pixels to REM (Root Em) units to scale website elements across different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent appearance and excellent user experience.

(!) Look up the `rem` value corresponding to `24px` from the table.
| px  | 12    | 14    | 16    | 18p   | 20    | 22    | 24    | 26    | 28    |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| rem | 0.75  | 0.875 | 1     | 1.125 | 1.25  | 1.375 | 1.5   | 1.625 | 1.75  |

```html
<h1 class="**font:1.5rem**">
```

(o) Omit the text size unit and rely on the default conversion.
```html
<h1 class="**font:24**">
```
Generated CSS
```css
.font\:24 {
    font-size: 1.5rem
}
```
This not only improves productivity but also simplifies syntax markup in class attributes.

### Why not just inline styles?
(x) Inline styles cannot apply selectors, media queries, or CSS features.
```html
<button style="font-size: 0.875rem" disabled>Oops!</button>
```

(o) You can now easily control style states in markup.
```html
<button class="font:14 font:20**@md** opacity:.5**[disabled]**" disabled>Bravo!</button>
```

(o) Build a visually consistent UI with [design tokens](/docs/configuration).
```html
<h1 class="font:lg fg:primary">Hello World</h1>
```

## Humanize
"I'd need to learn a new language to use Master CSS."

Rest assured, the Master CSS syntax is based on native CSS, positioned very similarly to [SASS](https://sass-lang.com). You can begin by writing familiar native-ish CSS and gradually incorporate our enhancements and syntactic sugar over time.

### Structured syntax
Writing the same syntax as `style=""` within `class=""` serves no purpose. We aim to provide a logically simplified CSS declaration with an elegant syntax.

It can be reducible:
```html
<!-- Same as native CSS -->
<div class="text-align:center">

<!-- Ambiguous shorthand -->
<div class="text:center">

<!-- Abbreviation -->
<div class="t:center">
```
It can be elegant:
```html
<!-- Set the background to blue-60 with an opacity of .5 -->
<div class="bg:blue-60/.5">

<!-- Magnify to 1.5x -->
<div class="scale(1.5)">

<!-- Transition with a delay of 0.3s and timing-function "ease" -->
<div class="~transform|.3s|ease">

<!-- Use a semantic class that translates to "display: block" -->
<div class="block">
```
It can be [stateful and selectable](/docs/selectors):
```html
<!-- Set a pink background on hover -->
<div class="bg:pink:hover">

<!-- Set a pink background for all subsequent sibling elements -->
<div class="bg:pink~*">

<!-- All subsequent div siblings -->
<div class="bg:pink+div">

<!-- All descendant p elements -->
<div class="bg:pink_:where(p)">

<!-- Use simplified :first instead of :nth-child to set pink background -->
<div class="bg:pink:first">
```
It can be [responsive](/docs/viewports) and [conditional](/docs/media-queries):
```html
<!-- Set width to 50rem, when screen width >=1024 -->
<div class="width:800@>=1024">

<!-- Similar to previous example, using a built-in breakpoint -->
<div class="width:800@sm">

<!-- Screen width >= 600px & < 1279.98px top at 0.0625rem -->
<div class="top:1@xs&<lg">

<!-- Set background to gray-20 when in dark mode -->
<div class="bg:gray-20@dark">

<!-- Hide element for print -->
<div class="hide@print">

<!-- Fade with a 0.2s delay when low motion is not specified by the client -->
<div class="@fade|.2s@motion">
```
These examples are only the tip of the iceberg.

### Readable markup
A factual study by [PPIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_programming) finds that syntax highlighting helps comprehension and reduces time to internalize a language.

(!) This is a template markup written by a utility-first framework.
```jsx
<div class="mt-9 rounded-lg flex text-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-200 sm:bg-slate-300">
<div class="mt-9 rounded-lg flex text-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-200 sm:bg-slate-300">
<div class="mt-9 rounded-lg flex text-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-200 sm:bg-slate-300">
```
(o) Improve readability with syntax highlighting.
```html
<div class="mt:36 r:8 flex fg:slate-70 bg:slate-20:hover bg:slate-30@sm">
<div class="mt:36 r:8 flex fg:slate-70 bg:slate-20:hover bg:slate-30@sm">
<div class="mt:36 r:8 flex fg:slate-70 bg:slate-20:hover bg:slate-30@sm">
```
We take pride in the experience improvement of syntax highlighting in template markup. This feature effectively reduces discomfort caused by "long class names" and facilitates a quick understanding of the overall style.

Thanks to the [structured syntax](#structured-syntax) of Master CSS, you can now grasp the prettier markup.

Master CSS also features autocompletion, generated CSS preview, and more. Check out our [Language Service](/docs/language-service) for more information.

## Separation of concerns

Many folks believe that HTML and CSS should conform to the design principle of separation of concerns (SoC). We believe that applying SoC to HTML & CSS, is more a matter of cultural momentum, and over-interpretation of SoC.

JavaScript aside, web UI consists of HTML structure, and CSS for styling. CSS takes up a significant portion of time spent working on HTML and its related business logic. This implies that HTML and CSS are highly integrated and almost always used together.

Separating the two introduces a layer of abstraction where the cost usually outweigh the benefit, leading to [premature abstraction](#premature-abstraction).

> **You should focus on the separation/componentization of business responsibilities, not language separation.**
