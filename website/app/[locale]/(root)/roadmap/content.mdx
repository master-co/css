## Release phases
Now that we're **at the release candidate**, we can more accurately estimate arrival times based on the task at hand:

- **Master CSS v2.0**
    1. <del>Alpha － 2.0.0-alpha.80</del>
    2. <del>Beta － 2.0.0-beta.215</del>
    3. **Release Candidate** － <svg className="mr:1x inline-block v:middle fill:green size:2x overflow:visible" viewBox="0 0 8 8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle className="@ping|1s|infinite transform:center" cx="4" cy="4" r="4" /><circle cx="4" cy="4" r="4" /></svg> [{version}](https://github.com/master-co/css/releases)
    4. Stable － April 2024
- **Master UI v1.0**
    1. Alpha - ?
    2. Beta - ?
    3. Release Candidate - ?
    4. Stable － August 2024
- **Master UI Pro v1.0** － December 2024

Since the syntax and API of Master CSS are expected to be in use for many years, even though v2 is nearing completion, it will take us some time to validate its market acceptance and solidify its foundation.

At this stage, **Master CSS is nearly stable**, which means there will be no further breaking changes.

## Current tasks
### 🟠 Improving documentation
Initially, the v1 docs were rushed into release, making its content rather rudimentary and potentially challenging to comprehend.

Our goal for our upcoming v2 docs is to present a comprehensive and elegantly crafted syntax document. This enables developers to grasp the intricacies of CSS effortlessly, thus enhancing understanding through our meticulous documentation.
